    <h1>Wolf Species</h1>
    <p>By Jinhee Han
      <br>Written 2020, November 28
      <br><br>There are three main species of wolves that are recognized today - the
      gray wolf, red wolf, and Eastern wolf. These species are further divided into
      various subspecies depending on the area they occupy. For example, gray Wolves
      that have adapted to living in cold environments are called artic wolves.
      All three species share similarities as they share a common ancestor. However,
      evolution has contributed to substantial differences. In this article, we
      will be covering information unique to each species.

  <p>
    Gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>), also known as the timber wolf, are
    the most common species of wolves. Some subspecies include the artic wolf
    (<em>Canis lupus arctos</em>), northwestern wolf (<em>Canis lupus occidentalis
    </em>), great plains wolf (<em>Canis lupus nubilus</em>), and mexican
    wolf (<em>Canis lupus baileyi</em>). While originating in North America,
    gray wolves can be found in Australia, Europe, Asia, Middle America, as
    well as North America. They live in forests, wetlands, deserts, and rocky
    areas. A typical adult is 4-6 feet (120-200 cm) long and weighs 40-175
    pounds (18-79 kg). As its names suggests, gray wolves usually have gray fur.
    However, pure white and black variations exist.

  <h3>Red Wolf</h3>

    The red wolf (<em>Canis rufus</em>) is currently the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/3747/163509841" target="_blank"> most endangered wolf species</a>. They are only found in Eastern
    North Carolina due to predator control programs from the early 20th century.
    Red wolves are mostly brown with black along their blacks and reddish fur
    located on their ears, head, and legs. The average adult weighs 40-80 pounds
    (18-36 kg).It is 4 feet long (120 cm) and around 25 inches (63 cm) wide, making it
    slightly smaller than the average gray wolf.

  <h3>Eastern Wolf</h3>
  <p>The Eastern Wolf (<em>Canis lycaon</em>) was originally categorized as a
    subspecies of the gray wolf. However, new data lead scientists to believe that
    eastern wolves are an entirely different species. Eastern wolves are only found
    in North America.
